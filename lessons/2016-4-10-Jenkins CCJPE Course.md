Introduction
------------
Welcome to the DevOps Library!  This is Samantha, and welcome to our Jenkins Certification course!  If you haven’t heard, *Cloudbees* (the creators of Jenkins) recently released two certifications, the **CJE** and **CCJPE**.  This is awesome for a few reasons:  First, we love using Jenkins for just about everything.  Secondly, it’s by far one of the most popular tools in the DevOps community for Continuous Integration and Continuous delivery.  And lastly, because up until now, there hasn’t been a way to prove proficiency with the open source or enterprise edition of Jenkins.

Certifications
--------------
The **CJE**, or **“Certified Jenkins Engineer”** exam consists of 60 questions that tests proficiency with the open source edition of Jenkins.  In order to pass, we’ll need to know how to design and implement a full CI/CD process, knowledge of best practices with Jenkins, as well as how to use and configure quite a few plugins.

The **CCJPE**, or **“Certified Cloudbees Jenkins Platform Engineer”**, doesn’t just have a name that’s hard to say.  It features the same 60 questions as the CJE, but adds an additional 30 questions on the enterprise features of Jenkins.

Course Outline
--------------
In this course, we’re going to focus on preparing for the **CCJPE**, that way you’ll become an expert with both the open source and enterprise Jenkins platforms.  

If somehow you haven’t used Jenkins yet, we HIGHLY recommend watching some of our other videos to see why we love it so much.  It’s an extremely flexible open source automation server, and works great for development teams, operations, and more.  If one of your goals is continuous integration or continuous delivery, Jenkins is one of, if not the best tool for the job.  

Well that’s probably enough compliments for *Cloudbees*, let’s talk about the test, since that’s what you’re here for!  The **CJJPE** consists of 90 questions on the following 5 topics:

*	Core Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Concepts behind Jenkins
*	Jenkins Usage
*	How to build Continuous Delivery Pipelines
*	Continuous Delivery as Code Best Practices
*	And Lastly, the enterprise edition of Jenkins, now known as the *Cloudbees Jenkins Platform*.
