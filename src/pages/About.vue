            My name is Samantha Ventura, and I am the Director of Learning Initiatives for the DevOpsLibrary.  I am a
            native Californian, and have been in the field of education for the past 15 years. I received my BA degree
            in English from San Diego State University, then later my Masters in Teaching, with a specialization in
            Reading.  My PhD is in Organizational Leadership and I work as an executive trainer and learning coach,
            specializing in the area of higher education and diversity awareness. In my spare time I love everything
            outdoors, including skiing, fishing, camping and spending time with my family.</a></p>

            Hi, I'm Ken Erwin &amp; I work behind the scenes writing the content for the courses & the website, as well as
            designing new tools for the DevOps community.  I've led DevOps initiatives at numerous companies, including
            implementing CI/CD@Angie's List, OpenStack@Interactive Intelligence, leading the Infra-Automation@Salesforce,
            and am currently serving as Chief Architect for KAR, primarily working on Kubernetes (both on-prem and cloud).

            <br/><br/>
            I have a B.S. in Informatics and an M.B.A from IU Kelley with a specialization in entrepreneurship.
            In my spare time, I love running (slowly!), random hobbies that seem to change monthly, and spending time with
            my family too :).
